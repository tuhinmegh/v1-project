# Translation notes

Are you interested in translating the website to your language? Here are some notes that might help you.

## Path
All the translations are located in the `src/locales` folder. Each language has its own file, for example, the English version is located in `src/locales/en.json`.

## Structure
The structure of the file could be as follows:

```json
{
    "key": "value",
    "key2": "value2",
    "key3": {
        "key4": "value4"
    },
    "labels" : {
        "under_dev": "Under development"
    }
}
```

## Developer or non-developer
Are you a developer, or do you understand how to use git? 
 - You can fork the repository, add your translation and create a pull request.
 - You can edit the file and create a pull request.

If you are not a developer, You can easily download the file and edit it with a text editor. Then you can send it to us on CawBuilders (Telegram)[https://t.me/cawbuilders] and we will add it to the website.
